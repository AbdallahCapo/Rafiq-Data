Local fishermen still practice traditional pearl diving, a craft that has been passed down for generations. The remote nature of the islands means few visitors make the journey, ensuring a tranquil and authentic experience. Whether exploring the underwater world or simply enjoying the unspoiled beauty of the islands, Farasan is a hidden paradise waiting to be discovered."

    "Q": "What is an unknown underground city in Jordan?",
    "A": "While most visitors flock to Petra, few know about the underground city of Umm al-Jimal, located near the Syrian border. Often called the 'Black Gem of the Desert,' this ancient Nabatean and Roman city is built entirely from black basalt stone, creating an eerie and mystical atmosphere. Unlike Petra, where tourists crowd the Siq, Umm al-Jimal remains nearly deserted, allowing visitors to explore its labyrinthine passageways, hidden cisterns, and multi-story homes at their own pace. Many of the structures here remain intact, with staircases leading to rooftops that offer panoramic views of the vast desert. Historians believe this city was a major trade hub, with evidence of complex water systems and storage facilities. Some rooms still contain ancient inscriptions left by Nabatean traders. For those looking to experience Jordan’s rich history without the crowds, Umm al-Jimal offers an extraordinary journey into the past."

    "Q": "Where in Egypt can you visit an abandoned palace with stunning architecture?",
    "A": "The Baron Empain Palace, located in Cairo’s Heliopolis district, is a forgotten masterpiece of Indo-European architecture. Built in the early 20th century by Belgian industrialist Édouard Empain, this grand palace was inspired by Hindu temples in India and Cambodia. Unlike Cairo’s more famous historic sites, the Baron Palace is surrounded by mystery and eerie legends. Locals believe the palace is haunted, adding to its intrigue. The building’s walls are adorned with elaborate carvings of elephants, serpents, and battle scenes, showcasing an architectural style rarely seen in Egypt. Though partially restored, much of the palace remains in a state of decay, giving visitors a rare glimpse into Egypt’s colonial past. At sunset, the golden light illuminates its intricate façade, making it one of Cairo’s most photogenic yet underrated landmarks."

    "Deep within the rugged mountains of the Asir region in southern Saudi Arabia, the village of Rijal Almaa stands as a breathtaking testament to the kingdom’s rich history. Known for its multistory stone houses decorated with white quartz patterns, this hidden village dates back over 900 years and was once an important trading hub between Yemen and the Levant. What makes Rijal Almaa truly special is its well-preserved architectural style, which blends seamlessly into the mountainous landscape. Inside the village, visitors will find a small but fascinating museum showcasing ancient manuscripts, traditional Asiri dresses, and old weapons used by the region’s warriors. Despite its historical significance, Rijal Almaa remains relatively undiscovered compared to other heritage sites in Saudi Arabia, offering travelers a rare glimpse into the kingdom’s lesser-known past.",
    
    "In the remote eastern region of Algeria, the ancient city of Timgad remains one of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Africa, yet it is often overshadowed by more famous sites like Carthage or Leptis Magna. Built in the 1st century AD by Emperor Trajan, Timgad was once a thriving Roman military colony, designed with a perfectly symmetrical grid layout that still astonishes archaeologists today. The city’s forum, library, and grand arch remain standing, offering an unparalleled look into daily Roman life. Unlike many other Roman sites, Timgad sees few visitors, meaning those who venture here can explore its ancient streets in near solitude. The most striking feature is the massive Arch of Trajan, which has stood for nearly 2,000 years, marking the city’s entrance against the backdrop of the Aurès Mountains. Walking through the ruins, it’s easy to imagine the once-bustling streets filled with merchants, scholars, and Roman soldiers.",
    
    "Hidden in the heart of the Egyptian desert, the White Desert National Park is one of the most surreal landscapes on the planet. Located about 500 kilometers southwest of Cairo, this otherworldly region is filled with massive chalk formations sculpted by centuries of wind erosion. Some of these formations resemble giant mushrooms, camels, or even mythical creatures, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that feels almost extraterrestrial. Unlike the bustling tourist spots of the Nile Valley, the White Desert offers complete isolation, with only the sound of the wind sweeping across the dunes. Bedouin guides lead visitors through the area, setting up traditional desert camps under the stars. At night, the sky comes alive with a blanket of stars, making the White Desert one of the best stargazing spots in Egypt. Few people make the journey here, but those who do are rewarded with a landscape unlike anything else in the world.",
    
    "While most visitors to Morocco explore the bustling medinas of Marrakech and Fez, few venture to the hidden blue village of Chefchaouen’s Akchour Waterfalls. Located deep within the Rif Mountains, Akchour is a paradise of cascading waterfalls, lush green valleys, and crystal-clear natural pools. The hike to the waterfalls takes visitors through scenic gorges and wooden bridges, with the opportunity to swim in cool, refreshing water along the way. What makes Akchour particularly special is its connection to local Berber communities, who have lived in the surrounding mountains for centuries. Unlike the more famous Ouzoud Waterfalls, Akchour remains largely untouched by mass tourism, allowing travelers to experience an authentic side of Moroccan nature. At the end of the trail, visitors are rewarded with a breathtaking view of the Grand Cascade, a towering waterfall that plunges into an emerald pool below.",
    
    "The southern coast of Oman hides a spectacular natural wonder known as Mughsail Blowholes, located near the city of Salalah. These blowholes, formed by underground tunnels in the limestone rock, shoot powerful jets of seawater high into the air when waves crash against the shore. Unlike the more popular beaches in Salalah, Mughsail remains a hidden gem, visited mostly by locals and adventurous travelers. The area surrounding the blowholes is equally stunning, with rugged cliffs, turquoise waters, and hidden sea caves that can be explored during low tide. The region is also home to unique flora, including frankincense trees that have been harvested for their precious resin since ancient times. During the Khareef monsoon season, the entire landscape transforms into a lush green paradise, making Mughsail one of the most unique coastal destinations in the Arabian Peninsula.",
    
    "In the far north of Sudan, along the banks of the Nile, lies the mysterious archaeological site of Soleb Temple. Built by the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III in the 14th century BC, this hidden treasure is often called the 'Luxor of Sudan' due to its stunning resemblance to the temples of ancient Egypt. However, unlike Luxor, which is filled with tourists, Soleb remains almost completely deserted, allowing visitors to wander through its towering sandstone columns in solitude. The temple’s hieroglyphic inscriptions and intricate carvings tell the story of Egypt’s expansion into Nubia and the cultural blending that took place between the two civilizations. Reaching Soleb requires crossing the Nile by boat and driving through remote desert villages, making it an adventure reserved for true history enthusiasts. Those who make the journey will be rewarded with a breathtaking glimpse into a lost chapter of African and Egyptian history.",
    
    "Jordan is famous for Petra, but few visitors know about the hidden desert castles that dot the eastern landscapes. One of the most remarkable is Qasr Amra, a UNESCO World Heritage site built in the early 8th century during the Umayyad dynasty. Unlike the grand palaces of Damascus or Baghdad, Qasr Amra is a modest-looking structure from the outside, but its interior is a masterpiece of Islamic art. The walls and ceilings are covered in vivid frescoes depicting hunting scenes, zodiac signs, and even rare portrayals of Umayyad caliphs, making it one of the most unique artistic treasures in the Arab world. Historians believe Qasr Amra was used as a royal retreat, where caliphs would relax in steam baths and discuss matters of the empire. Despite its historical significance, Qasr Amra remains largely off the beaten path, offering travelers a chance to experience one of the oldest surviving examples of Islamic fresco art without the crowds.",
    
    "The small village of Matmata in southern Tunisia is home to one of the most unusual architectural styles in the world—underground troglodyte houses. These ancient cave dwellings, carved directly into the soft sandstone, have been inhabited for centuries by the Berber people, who designed them to protect against the extreme desert temperatures. What makes Matmata particularly fascinating is that many families still live in these underground homes today, preserving a way of life that has changed little over generations. The village gained international fame when it was used as a filming location for the Star Wars movies, serving as Luke Skywalker’s home on the desert planet of Tatooine. Despite this, Matmata remains a hidden gem, visited mostly by those seeking an authentic glimpse into Tunisia’s indigenous heritage. Travelers can even stay in a traditional troglodyte hotel, experiencing firsthand the incredible ingenuity of Berber architecture."

"The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, with its golden dome and intricate tilework, is a masterpiece of early Islamic architecture. In later centuries, the Mamluks of Egypt and the Ottomans introduced domed structures, grand entrances, and elaborate muqarnas (stalactite-like decorations), further enriching the architectural landscape of the Arab world."
],
"Arab Contributions to Science and Knowledge" :[
"During the Islamic Golden Age (8th–14th centuries), Arab scholars made groundbreaking contributions to various fields",
"Mathematicians like Al-Khwarizmi developed algebra, while astronomers like Al-Battani refined astronomical calculations that influenced European navigators.",
"The House of Wisdom in Baghdad became a center for translation and innovation, preserving Greek, Indian, and Persian texts. Arab physicians such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) wrote medical encyclopedias that remained standard references in Europe for centuries.",

],

"Trade played a crucial role in the spread of Arab culture, art, and architecture. The Arabian Peninsula was a crossroads for merchants traveling between Africa, Asia, and Europe.",

"Arabic Dialects – A Mosaic of Identity and Expression": [
  "Arabic is not a single, uniform language but a collection of dialects, each shaped by history, geography, and cultural influences. While Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) serves as the official language of media, literature, and diplomacy, everyday communication relies on regional dialects, known as Aamiya. These dialects vary significantly from country to country, sometimes even from city to city, making spoken Arabic one of the most diverse linguistic landscapes in the world.",
  "The Maghrebi dialects, spoken in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania, are known for their heavy influence from Berber languages and French. They are often difficult for speakers of Middle Eastern dialects to understand due to their unique pronunciation and grammatical structures. Moroccan Darija, for example, drops many short vowels, creating a fast-paced and rhythmic speech that sounds distinct from Levantine or Gulf Arabic.",
  "In contrast, the Levantine dialects, spoken in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine, are considered some of the most melodious and easy to understand. They feature a softer pronunciation, with many words ending in vowels, making them more accessible to learners. Lebanese Arabic, in particular, has been heavily influenced by French and English due to historical colonial ties, resulting in frequent code-switching in daily conversation.",
  "The Egyptian dialect, rooted in Cairo, has achieved near-universal recognition due to Egypt’s dominance in Arab media and cinema. It is widely understood across the Arab world and often serves as a bridge between speakers of different dialects. Egyptian Arabic simplifies many grammatical rules found in Classical Arabic and includes unique expressions and phrases that have become part of everyday speech.",
  "The Gulf dialects, spoken in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and parts of Oman, have preserved many classical Arabic structures while incorporating elements from Persian, Hindi, and English due to historical trade routes. In the Najdi dialect of central Saudi Arabia, older words and traditional pronunciations remain intact, making it one of the closest dialects to Classical Arabic. However, in the cosmopolitan cities of the Gulf, such as Dubai and Doha, Arabic has evolved to include a vast array of borrowed terms from international languages.",
  "Despite these differences, all Arabic dialects share a common linguistic foundation. A speaker from Tunisia may struggle to understand a Yemeni dialect at first, but they can adjust by recognizing familiar root words and sentence structures. Television, music, and social media have also played a significant role in bridging dialectal gaps, allowing Arab speakers to become more familiar with variations outside their native regions.",
  "One of the most fascinating aspects of Arabic dialects is their deep connection to cultural identity. Dialects are not just a means of communication but also a reflection of history, geography, and societal influences. In some cases, specific accents and phrases can indicate a person’s city, village, or even social class. In Lebanon, for example, the pronunciation of certain letters, such as the ق (qaf), can distinguish whether a person is from Beirut, the mountains, or the south. Similarly, in Iraq, the use of Shami (Levantine) Arabic versus Mesopotamian Arabic can signal differences in background and regional identity.",
  "While some linguists worry about the growing influence of English and French on Arabic dialects, many argue that this evolution is a natural part of linguistic development. The Arabic language has always been dynamic, absorbing new words and adapting to cultural shifts. Whether through poetry, social media, or urban slang, Arabic dialects continue to thrive, preserving the richness and diversity of Arab identity."

"Arabic Calligraphy – The Art of the Written Word": [
  "Arabic calligraphy is more than just writing; it is a sacred art form that has been revered for centuries. Rooted in Islamic tradition, calligraphy developed as a way to express beauty, spirituality, and linguistic artistry. Since Islam discourages the depiction of human and animal figures in religious art, calligraphy became the primary medium for artistic expression, adorning mosques, manuscripts, palaces, and everyday objects with verses from the Quran, poetry, and philosophical reflections.",
  "The origins of Arabic calligraphy date back to the 7th century, when the first copies of the Quran were written in Kufic script, a bold and angular style that was well-suited for inscriptions on stone and parchment. Over time, this early script evolved into various styles, each with its own distinct aesthetic and purpose. One of the most elegant forms is Thuluth script, known for its curved, flowing letters and elongated vertical lines, often used for mosque inscriptions and architectural decoration. Naskh script, on the other hand, is more practical and legible, making it the preferred style for printed books and everyday writing.",
  "Another famous style is Diwani script, which was developed in the Ottoman era and is characterized by its intricate loops and flourishes. This script was often used in royal decrees and official documents due to its complexity, making it difficult to forge. In contrast, Ruqʿah script is the most commonly used in modern handwriting because of its simplicity and ease of use.",
  "One of the most fascinating aspects of Arabic calligraphy is its adaptability. Calligraphers often experiment with shapes and forms, incorporating elements of geometry, symmetry, and movement to create visually stunning compositions. Some calligraphic works are arranged in circular or spiral patterns, while others take the shape of animals, birds, or architectural structures. This fusion of language and art reflects the deep connection between spirituality and aesthetics in Arab culture.",
  "Throughout history, calligraphy has played a crucial role in preserving knowledge and heritage. During the Islamic Golden Age, calligraphers meticulously copied and illustrated scientific, medical, and philosophical texts, ensuring that knowledge was passed down through generations. These manuscripts, often adorned with gold leaf and intricate arabesque designs, are now treasured in museums and libraries worldwide.",
  "Even in the modern era, Arabic calligraphy remains an important symbol of cultural identity. Contemporary artists blend traditional styles with modern influences, creating calligraphic graffiti, digital art, and abstract compositions that celebrate the beauty of the Arabic script. Calligraphy is also widely used in branding, fashion, and design, proving its timeless appeal and adaptability.",
  "Beyond its aesthetic value, Arabic calligraphy carries a deep spiritual significance. Writing Quranic verses in beautiful script is considered an act of devotion, and many Muslims believe that calligraphy enhances the sanctity of religious texts. Calligraphers undergo years of rigorous training to master the art, often studying under renowned masters to perfect their technique. The process requires patience, discipline, and a deep understanding of the language’s structure and rhythm.",
  "As Arabic calligraphy continues to evolve, it serves as a bridge between the past and the present, connecting generations through the beauty of the written word. Whether etched in stone, painted on canvas, or displayed on digital screens, Arabic calligraphy remains one of the most cherished and enduring art forms in the Arab world."
],  
  "The Poetry of Arabic Idioms": [
    "Idioms play a significant role in everyday Arabic conversation. They often draw from nature, religion, and historical events, making them a vibrant reflection of Arab culture.",

Stay close to your group, be patient, and maintain a sense of calm amidst the bustling energy. Understanding that everyone is on their own spiritual journey helps in fostering patience and cooperation.",
  "Personal Hygiene": "Maintaining personal hygiene can be a struggle on Hajj. Shared facilities and the sheer number of people can make this challenge more pronounced.

Embrace technology as a helpful tool but remain adaptable to unforeseen circumstances.",
  "Post-Hajj Adjustment": "Returning to daily life after the spiritual intensity of Hajj can be a difficult adjustment.

"Important Moments of the 20th Century in the Arab World": {
  "1917 – Britain captures Palestine": "**The British Mandate in Palestine had its origins in the end of World War I. Before World War I, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire. The December before the Armistice that ended World War I, a British general and his troops captured Jerusalem. The League of Nations “mandated” what was then Palestine to British rule. However, by the time Palestine was mandated to British rule, the British had made numerous conflicting promises about what would happen in the region. They had agreed to recognize Arab independence, agreed to divide the territories in the Middle East between themselves and the French, and also committed themselves to a “national home” for the Jewish people. So began 30 years of British rule in Palestine.**",
  "1948 – State of Israel declared": "**The modern State of Israel has its origins in the Zionist movement, led by Theodor Herzl. He identified Ottoman-controlled Palestine as the most desirable location, and unsuccessfully petitioned the Ottoman government for a charter. When the British issued the Balfour Declaration, committing themselves to a “national home” for the Jewish people, they also committed themselves to Arab independence in the region. Unable to find a practical solution, they turned the matter over to the United Nations, which voted to partition Palestine. Following the announcement of an independent Israel, five Arab nations invaded the region in what is now known as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.**",
  "1956 – Suez Crisis": "**The Suez Crisis was precipitated by Egyptian President Gamal Nasser’s decision to nationalize the Suez Canal. It had been jointly controlled by the British and the French, but Nasser wanted Egyptian control over the Canal. France joined Britain in an invasion of Egypt, and Israeli forces attacked the Sinai Peninsula. Anglo-French forces began bombing Egyptian targets and occupying strategic positions in the Canal zone. The U.N. called for a cease-fire, and both the Soviet Union and the United States called for the French and British to withdraw. An incredibly important moment in Arab history, the Suez Crisis made clear that the United States and the Soviet Union were now the big international players in the region, rather than France and Great Britain.**",
  "1962 – Algerian Independence": "**The Algerian War, also known as the Algerian War of Independence, was fought between France and the Algerian National Liberation Front. From 1954 to 1962, this was both a war between Algerian forces and the French, as well as a civil war within Algeria. The French employed very brutal methods, including torture, which helped to turn the tide of public support in France and in the international community against the war. There was a U.N. Declaration supporting Algerian independence, and in 1962, Algeria gained independence from France.**",
  "1967 – Six-Day War": "**The Six-Day War, also known as the June War, was the third of the Arab-Israeli wars. In response to the apparent mobilization and escalation of Arab forces, Israel staged a preemptive air assault on Egyptian and Syrian air forces. Without their forces in the air, both militaries were vulnerable to attack. Within three days, the Israelis had achieved an overwhelming victory on the ground, capturing the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula. The lopsidedness of the defeat demoralized the Arab public, and marked a new start in the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Months after the war, the U.N. passed UNSCR 242, which called for Israel to withdraw from all the territories it had captured in exchange for lasting peace.**",
  "1975 – Lebanese Civil War begins": "**Conflict erupted in Beirut after members of a Christian militia attacked a bus, killing 27 of its mainly Palestinian passengers. Prior to the war, Lebanon had both Muslims and Christians, who tended to support different sides in the Cold War. Also, the arrival of Palestinian refugees after the 1948 War led to a demographic shift in favor of Muslims. Fighting lasted until 1989, when the Taif Agreement marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War. The Lebanese Civil War lasted from 1975 to 1990, making it an incredibly important moment in Arab history.**",
  "1979 – Militants Seize US Embassy in Iran": "**From 1797-1981, militants in Iran held 52 Americans hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for over a year. This took place in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution and its overthrow of the monarchy. This revolution changed Iran’s relationship with the United States. The international community deeply opposed Iran’s taking of hostages, and the U.S. instituted an embargo of Iranian oil.**",
  "1981 – Anwar Sadat assassinated": "**On October 6, 1981, the President of Egypt, Anwar Sadat, was assassinated, in large part due to his signing of the Camp David Accords with Israeli Prime Minister Menachim Begin. Sadat had strengthened ties with the United States and won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on the Camp David Accords. However, certain factions within Egypt believed that the peace deal with Israel was too revolutionary and anti-Arab, and plotted to kill Sadat.**",
  "1990 – Gulf War": "**Iraqi President ordered the invasion and occupation of neighboring Kuwait in 1990. This led to fellow Arab powers, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as well as the United States, intervening in the region. The war began with a massive U.S.-led air assault known as Operation Desert Storm. After 42 days, U.S. President George W. Bush declared a cease-fire. At this time, most Iraqi forces in Kuwait had either surrendered or fled. Though initially considered a success by the international community, the Persian Gulf War laid the groundwork for a second Gulf War to start in 2003.**",
  "1993 – Oslo Accords": "**The Oslo Accords initially began as secret talks between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in Oslo in 1993. Neither side wanted to acknowledge their presence at the talks. The Camp David Accords served as a base point for the new negotiations, and the Norwegians served as mediators. There were two separate agreements that made up the Oslo Accords. Oslo I, in 1993, included mutual recognition by the PLO and Israel, established a freely elected Parliament for Palestine, and set the parameters for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Oslo II, in 1995, built upon Oslo I and included discussion of the future governance of Jerusalem, as well as issues concerning border security.**"

"When Morocco Almost Became a Portuguese Colony": {
  "The Origins of the Conflict": "By the mid-16th century, Portugal had already established numerous fortified coastal settlements along Morocco’s Atlantic coastline, including Ceuta, Tangier, and Mazagan (modern-day El Jadida). These outposts were part of Portugal’s broader strategy to control trade routes and expand its influence in Africa. However, Portuguese ambitions were largely restricted to the coast, as they lacked control over Morocco’s interior.",
  "The Battle of the Three Kings: A Catastrophic Defeat": "In July 1578, King Sebastian and his forces landed in Morocco and began their march toward the interior. However, they underestimated the military capabilities of the Saadian dynasty. Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik, now the reigning sultan, had consolidated his power and prepared a formidable army to resist the invasion.",
  "The Aftermath: A Shift in Power": "The defeat at Ksar el-Kebir had devastating consequences for Portugal. With no direct heir to the throne, the Portuguese kingdom fell into a succession crisis. Two years later, in 1580, Spain took advantage of Portugal’s weakness and annexed the country, leading to a 60-year period of Iberian Union under Spanish rule. What had been intended as a grand imperial conquest turned into the loss of Portugal’s independence.",
  "Why Morocco Did Not Become a Portuguese Colony": "The Battle of the Three Kings was one of the most critical moments in Moroccan history. One of the key reasons Morocco avoided becoming a Portuguese colony was the strength of the Saadian dynasty’s military. The Moroccan army was well-organized, battle-hardened, and equipped with gunpowder weapons, allowing it to effectively counter European military tactics. In addition to military power, strategic leadership played a crucial role in resisting foreign invasions. Moroccan rulers demonstrated diplomatic skill, balancing relations between European and Ottoman powers while ensuring their kingdom remained independent. Geography also worked in Morocco’s favor. Unlike the coastal regions that fell under Portuguese control, Morocco’s rugged interior, with its mountains and deserts, made large-scale European invasions logistically difficult. Broader European political shifts also contributed to Portugal’s failure. The catastrophic defeat at Ksar el-Kebir significantly weakened Portugal’s empire, and just two years later, the country was absorbed into Spain. This shift in power diverted European attention away from Morocco, preventing further attempts at colonization during this period.",
  "A Defining Moment in Moroccan History": "The Battle of the Three Kings was far more than a single military engagement, it was a defining moment that shaped Morocco’s future. The crushing defeat of the Portuguese not only preserved Moroccan sovereignty but also altered the course of European colonial ambitions in North Africa. While Portugal retained control over a few coastal enclaves, it never again attempted to conquer Morocco’s interior."

"The Wind Catcher: Lessons From Traditional Arab Architecture": {
  "Arab America Contributing Writer": "The wind catcher, or wind tower, is a prevalent feature in the traditional architecture of various cities in the Arab World. They are typically found in settlements situated in hot and dry or hot and humid climates. They usually take the form of large chimneys in the skyline of cities. Wind catchers are vertical shafts with vents at the uppermost part, designed to direct desired winds into interior spaces and provide thermal comfort for the space below. This architectural element is an example of how architecture can harmonize with the natural environment by conserving energy and functioning based on sustainable principles.5",
  "A Brief History | Defining the Wind Tower": "In studying a region’s climate in depth, wind is one of the important elements to consider. This is due to wind currents that create differences in pressure on the exterior walls, which in turn affect the natural ventilation and interior air temperature of a structure. In conscious architecture, wind should be a key factor in the design of a structure.3",
  "Orientation and Function of the Wind Tower": "The orientation of a wind tower generally corresponds directly to the four main geographical directions: North, South, East, and West. The orientation of the openings depends on the direction from which the breeze arrives, thereby determining the desired direction. In some cases, the wind towers function as air suction devices, with the airflow turning away from the main wind source, creating a negative pressure region that allows warm air inside the house to be expelled.6",
  "Humidity, Heat, and Dryness": "In hot and dry regions, it is essential to increase indoor humidity to maintain comfortable living conditions. This can be achieved through evaporation. As the air passes through the wind tower, it flows over a water fountain upon entering the building, introducing humidity into various spaces within the structure.1In some examples, mats are placed inside the wind tower, with water poured over them to enhance the coolness and humidity of the airflow passing through.",
  "Functionality | The Tower in Hot and Humid Temperatures": "Hot and humid regions typically experience high humidity levels due to their proximity to the sea. In these areas, wind towers reduce temperature solely through airflow rather than by increasing indoor humidity, as additional moisture would make living conditions uncomfortable.",
  "The Elements of the Wind Catcher": "The wind catcher is composed of multiple elements, each essential to its overall function. The elements of a wind catcher, from bottom to top, are as follows: the chimney, the stalk, the catgut and chain, and the shelf.",
  "The Chimney": "Wind towers are typically classified by the number of directions they face to optimize wind conditions. These include one-, two-, four-, and eight-directional wind towers.",
  "The Stalk": "Wind towers are typically classified by the number of directions they face to optimize wind conditions. These include one-, two-, four-, and eight-directional wind towers.",
  "The Catgut and Chain": "Wind towers are typically classified by the number of directions they face to optimize wind conditions. These include one-, two-, four-, and eight-directional wind towers.",
  "The Shelf": "Wind towers are typically classified by the number of directions they face to optimize wind conditions. These include one-, two-, four-, and eight-directional wind towers.",
  "Modern Applications": "In modern times, many architects have recognized the significance of the wind catcher and its advantages. Numerous projects have been designed with this concept in mind. This article examines three examples of how the wind catcher has been implemented in contemporary architecture.",
  "Abdel-Rahman Nassif House": "The first contemporary structure to examine is the Abdel-Rahman Nassif House, designed by architect Hasan Fathy in 1974. Fathy designed a wind catcher with four open sides oriented toward the prevailing winds, incorporating closed shutters similar to those used in Iran, Oman, and Iraq. The wind would flow downward, come into contact with water bowls inside the wind catcher, and then circulate into other areas of the house, cooling the interior.11The house was intended as a gift from Abdel-Rahman Nassif to his two sons, and judging by its current condition and a newly renovated pool, it appears to be well-maintained and in use. Nassif also contributed to the design by adding a shutter system that allowed for precise control over which winds entered the wind catcher at any given time.",
  "Al-Sulaiman Palace": "The next example is the Al Sulaiman Palace in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, designed by Abdel Wahed Al Wakil in 1980. As a student of Hassan Fathy, Al Wakil’s approach to architecture shifted significantly from the Modernist style he had previously adopted. He applied Fathy’s architectural principles in his design, and at the Al Sulaiman Palace, one can see the resemblance to the wind catcher designed for the Abdel-Rahman Nassif House by Fathy a few years earlier.12 The palace is still maintained in excellent condition by its inhabitants, and its architectural and environmental significance earned it an Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1980.12",
  "Qatar University": "Another example is Qatar University, designed by Kamal Kafrawi in 1992. This project represents a reinterpretation of the wind catcher’s role in modern architecture. The building features numerous wind catchers elevated at different levels to optimize airflow from prevailing winds. Its simplified geometric form was designed to reflect the spirit of modernity while maintaining the wind catcher’s traditional function of directing air into the interior.13",
  "Lessons Learned": "By examining the specifics of wind catchers and how notable contemporary designers have incorporated them into their work, we can thoughtfully apply past knowledge to create more enduring, sustainable, and intelligent architecture for today and the future.",
  "Bibliography": "Ralph Hage, a Lebanese American architect and writer, divides his time and work between Lebanon and the United States."

"Poetry as Resistance: Iraqi and Palestinian Cultural Expression": {
  "By Zahraa Alrafish / Arab America Contributing Writer": "Throughout history, poetry and art have served as powerful tools of resistance, carrying the voices of the oppressed and preserving cultural identity in the face of adversity. For Iraqis and Palestinians, whose lands have been marked by conflict, displacement, and occupation, poetry has become more than just an artistic expression; it is an act of defiance, a means of survival, and a beacon of hope.",
  "The Role of Poetry in Cultural Resistance": "In both Iraq and Palestine, poetry has long been woven into the fabric of daily life. Rooted in oral traditions that date back centuries, poetry is not just a form of storytelling but also a way to document pain, resistance, and resilience. When political circumstances seek to erase identity, poetry stands as a reminder of who people are and where they come from.",
  "Art as a Weapon Against Oppression": "Beyond poetry, visual art has also played a significant role in cultural resistance for both Iraqis and Palestinians. Artists use their work to reclaim narratives, challenge stereotypes, and showcase the richness of their heritage in the face of attempts to erase it.",
  "Poetry in Protest Movements": "In recent years, poetry has continued to be a powerful tool in protest movements across Iraq and Palestine. During the 2019 protests in Iraq, young activists recited poetry in public squares, using it to demand justice, dignity, and an end to corruption. Their words became rallying cries, uniting people across different backgrounds in a common struggle.",
  "The Future of Resistance Through Art": "Despite the challenges faced by Iraqi and Palestinian communities, poetry and art continue to thrive as forms of resistance. Digital platforms and social media have provided new avenues for artists and poets to share their work with the world, reaching audiences far beyond their homelands. This has allowed for the formation of transnational solidarity networks, where the struggles of one community resonate with those of another."

"The History of the Hashemite Dynasty": {
  "Arab America Contributing Writer": "Several of the states in the Arab world are ruled by monarchies; Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Morocco are just a few examples of monarchies that exist there. However, only a few monarchical families can claim ancestry back to the Prophet Muhammad himself – one of these is the Hashemite Dynasty. Also called the House of Hashim, the Hashemites currently rule the country of Jordan – but this wasn’t always the case. This article will delve into the history of the Hashemites, and how they got to where they are now.",
  "Description and Claim": "The Hashemites, known asal-Hāshimiyyūnin Arabic, is a family lineage within the Dhawu Awn, one of the branches of the Hasanid Sharifs of Mecca. This title grants them stewardship over the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, a position the family has held for multiple generations. They received this title after one of their ancestors, Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-Hasani, conquered Mecca and Medina in the name of the Fatimid Caliphate.",
  "History as Sharifs of Mecca": "Ever since Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-Hasani’s conquering of Mecca and Medina, and his subsequent honor by being titled the Sharif of Mecca, his descendants within the Hashemite lineage have generally ruled – with interruptions – as Sharifs of Mecca for almost a millennia. This rule continued despite changes in power in the Middle East. An example of this can be seen when the Ottomans conquered Mamluk Egypt in 1517, causing the Hashemite Sharif of Mecca to proclaim his support for the Ottomans. However, a series of events in the modern era led to the Hashemites losing their position as Sharifs of Mecca.",
  "History as Rulers of Jordan and Iraq": "Although Faisal and Abdullah would both die in 1933 and 1951 respectively, the Hashemite dynasty continued to rule in both countries after their deaths. Both countries would achieve their independence from the British under the Hashemite dynasty, with Iraq achieving independence in 1932 and Jordan in 1946."

"Rejecting Division Between The Semitic Siblings": {
  "Arab America Contributing Writer": "In a world marked by divisions, the shared history of Arabs and Jews serves as a powerful reminder of our interconnectedness. These Semitic peoples have lived, traded, and celebrated side by side for centuries, united by shared values and traditions. Before the Zionism movement divided the brothers who were fooled in this trap. In this article, we’ll explore their common ancestry, linguistic roots, and cultural practices, offering a lens of unity and understanding. Join Yara Marei, Arab America Contributing Writer, as we delve into this fascinating and enduring connection.",
  "Shared Ancestry": "Arabs and Jews share a profound historical and genetic connection, tracing their origins to the patriarch Abraham (Ibrahim). According to religious traditions, Arabs are descended from Ishmael (Ismail), while Jews trace their lineage through Isaac (Ishaq), making them part of the same ancestral family tree. This bond reflects their shared roots and intertwined histories, spanning thousands of years.",
  "Both Are Semitic Peoples": "Arabs and Jews share deep roots as Semitic peoples, belonging to the same linguistic and ethnic family. Their languages, Arabic, Hebrew, and of course the Syriac language of the Bible, all stem from the Semitic language family and reveal striking similarities. These three languages are written from right to left and share overlapping grammatical structures and vocabulary. For instance, the words for “boy” areyeledin Hebrew andwaladin Arabic, while “girl” isbatin Hebrew andbintin Arabic. Even the word for “sun” closely aligns, withshemeshin Hebrew andshamsin Arabic. These linguistic connections highlight a rich shared heritage, shaped by centuries of cultural exchange and mutual influence.",
  "Cultural Parallels": "Arabs and Jews share a strong sense of tradition and cultural conservatism, evident in their shared values surrounding family, modesty, and community. Both groups emphasize the importance of marriage, inheritance, and living in accordance with ethical dietary laws, such ashalalfor Arabs andkosherfor Jews, which reflect their commitment to purity and faith. Modesty in dress is another shared principle, symbolizing respect for cultural and religious values.",
  "The Star of David: A Shared Symbol": "The Star of David, commonly associated with Jewish identity, also holds historical and spiritual significance in Arab and Islamic cultures. It has been found on artifacts adorned with Arabic inscriptions, symbolizing divine protection and guidance. In Islamic traditions, the star is often linked to prophets like David (Dawud) and Solomon (Suleiman), highlighting a shared spiritual heritage and mutual reverence for faith.",
  "Arab Jews: A History of Living Together": "The Jews of Nablus, known as the Samaritans or Alsamira, are a powerful example of the peaceful coexistence that once defined Arab-Jewish relationships. For centuries, these Palestinian Arab Jews have lived side by side with their Arab neighbors, sharing traditions and a strong sense of community. Unlike Zionism, a political ideology they reject, the Samaritans remain committed to their Palestinian identity and refuse Israeli citizenship, standing in solidarity with their Arab counterparts.",
  "A Shared Responsibility to Reject Division": "The shared history of Arabs and Jews shows that the divisions between them are not natural but created by political ideologies like Zionism. This movement, which promotes exclusion and displacement, has caused harm and disrupted the harmony that once existed. Many Arabs and Jews oppose Zionism, seeing it as a force that divides people and goes against shared values."

"The First and Second Moroccan Crises: Paving the Way to World War I": {
  "Arab America Contributing Writer": "In the early 20th century, the tensions between European powers over influence in Africa and other parts of the world contributed significantly to the outbreak of World War I. Among the most notable incidents were the First and Second Moroccan Crises, which not only showcased the growing rivalry between Germany and France but also underscored the fragility of international diplomacy at the time. These crises, occurring in 1905 and 1911 respectively, were instrumental in reshaping alliances and escalating tensions that ultimately led to the Great War."

"The Significance of Cats in Arab Culture": {
  "Arab America Contributing Writer": "Cats hold a special place in Arab culture, deeply intertwined with Islamic teachings and the region’s historical and social fabric. Revered for their elegance, independence, and utility, cats have long been celebrated as symbols of cleanliness and grace. This admiration is rooted not only in practical reasons but also in religious and cultural values that have elevated cats as cherished companions throughout Arab history."

"The Mystery of Fátima de Madrid": {
  "Arab America Contributing Writer": "We have all heard about the various astronomers, philosophers, and masters of the sciences in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age. One such figure from this period was Maslama al-Majriti, also known in Latin as Methilem, a scholar from Madrid during the time of Muslim rule. While he himself is the subject of some debate—due to works published long after his death that are either attributed to him or suspected to be the work of someone capitalizing on his name—there is another mystery surrounding him. This mystery involves his supposed daughter, Fátima de Madrid, who may not have existed at all. Allegedly an astronomer in her own right, if her story is true, she would be one of the earliest known female astronomers, standing out in a career dominated by men.",
  "Her Life, Supposedly": "Fátima de Madrid was an Arab Muslim astronomer and mathematician who supposedly lived during the 10th and 11th centuries in Al-Andalus, or Muslim-ruled Spain. Her father, Maslama al-Majriti, was, among other things, an astronomer who lived from 950 to 1007 CE. Little is known about Fátima’s personal life; most of what we know comes from accounts of her career and achievements. She is said to have lived in Córdoba when it was the capital of the Caliphate of Córdoba, which ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula. She was also reportedly fluent in multiple languages, including Arabic, Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.",
  "Controversy over her Existence": "Historians are skeptical about Fátima de Madrid’s existence primarily because she went unmentioned for several centuries. While the male-dominated society of her time might have dismissed or overlooked her achievements, the complete lack of any historical reference raises significant doubts. The first known mention of her is in 1924, in a Spanish encyclopedia called theEnciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana, commonly referred to as theEnciclopedia Espasa. This extensive work, spanning over 100,000 pages, delves deeply into numerous people, places, and subjects, but its late mention of Fátima has led to questions about her authenticity.",
  "Conclusion": "Fátima de Madrid’s career allegedly ranged from collaborating with her father to publishing her own works—though these works have either never been found or are rumored to be hidden in a monastery in Spain. Did her existence stem from a writer’s inaccurate 1924 encyclopedia entry, or did she actually exist? For now, contemporary historians largely agree that she did not, but perhaps time will reveal a definitive answer."
